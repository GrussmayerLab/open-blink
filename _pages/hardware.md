Welcome to our website dedicated to open hardware solutions in microscopy! Here, you will find information about the latest developments and advancements in open-source hardware for microscope systems. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource for those interested in building their own microscope systems or modifying existing ones using open-source hardware and software. Whether you are a researcher, hobbyist, or student, our goal is to empower you with the knowledge and tools to take control of your microscopy needs. Join us in advancing the field of microscopy through open-source innovation. As a great primer for interesting open hardware projects, consider visiting the [Delft Open Hardware community](https://github.com/delftopenhardware/awesome-open-hardware).
