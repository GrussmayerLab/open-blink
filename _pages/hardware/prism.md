# PRISM 
This setup is based on the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-018-0109-4">foundational study</a> for correlative superresolution fluorescence and multiplane quantitative phase microscopy. It is intended as a workhorse microscope for the Grussmayer Lab at TU Delft and has two excitation and detection paths. On the excitation side, four continuous wave laser sources of conventional wavelengths for biological applications (405nm, 488nm, 561nm, 642nm) and a diode laser (830nm) are mounted. Excitation paths are (I) a dyanmicaly adjustable dichroic based Epi-TIRF illumination, (II) a mirror based objective TIRF and (III) a manually positionable LED based white light transillumination. Detection paths are (1) a splitter for robust simultaneous four color imaging and (2) a multiplane imaging systems based on a 2x2-plane image splitter prism. 

The imlpementation we use at the Grussmayer Lab is based on a the RM21 MadCityLabs body, which is commercially licensed and can unfortunately not be shown in CAD. Hence we use reduced representations of the microscope in the following sections. However the PRISM implementation is not restricted to this body and can be facilitated with a multitutde of bodies.

### Main body 
The objective, the sample stages (also MadCityLabs) and the dichroic filter outlined here are added to the RM21 body from MadCityLabs (US)
